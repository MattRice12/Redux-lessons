*Event system* We use React's event system to capture user input, including form submissions and button clicks

*Refs* Refs allow us to reference DOM elements in our code after the component has been rendered.

*Callback functions* Parent components can pass callback functions as props to child components to allow two-way communication.

*Synthetic events* Synthetic events are a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event system.
  e.g., `onSubmit`
